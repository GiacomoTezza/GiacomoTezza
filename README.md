### About Me:
👋 Hey there, I'm Giacomo Tezza, a Computer Science Master's student at the University of Trento. I'm on a journey to explore the ever-evolving world of technology and software development. Here's a bit about what makes me tick:

💻 I'm deeply passionate about technology and thrive on staying up-to-date with cutting-edge tools and languages. Currently, I'm delving into Node.js, React, Express.js, and Docker to build scalable web applications. Python holds a special place in my heart, and I've had the pleasure of experimenting with a variety of programming languages throughout my journey.

🌐 One of my proudest achievements was developing a full-stack web app for my bachelor's degree thesis. This project, created in collaboration with a local company, was a project editor for shared projects, tackling issues like conflict resolution and versioning.

🤝 While I'm an open-source and Linux enthusiast, my contributions have mostly been on a smaller scale, focusing on personal projects. However, I'm eager to step up and make more substantial contributions in the open-source community in the future.

🛡️ In my ongoing studies, I'm excited to specialize in the field of cybersecurity. I believe that combining strong software development skills with a deep understanding of security is crucial in today's digital landscape. Additionally, I'm diving into the world of machine learning and related areas to broaden my knowledge and skill set.

🛹 Outside of coding and academics, you'll find me watching skateboard competitions (even though I'm not a pro on the board myself) and whipping up delicious meals for my girlfriend and me. Cooking is another one of my passions that allows me to express creativity in a different way.

<!--📫 Let's connect and discuss all things tech, open source, or even skateboarding! Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourname) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yourtwitterhandle). I'm always eager to network, collaborate, and learn from fellow enthusiasts.-->

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, and I look forward to sharing this incredible journey with you!
